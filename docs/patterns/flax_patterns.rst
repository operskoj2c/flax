Flax patterns
==================

Flax is flexible, and its functional roots creates different ways of achieving the same result.
For that reason, we're gathering here "patterns" that show users best practices coming 
from the Flax team experience.

This is a work in progress and we'll add new notes here along the way, however if you would 
like to see specific topics covered, feel free to start a discussion or open
an issue on our `GitHub repo <https://github.com/google/flax>`__.
