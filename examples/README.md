# Flax Examples

This folder contains a collection of examples of implementations of various architectures and training procedures.
In collecting these examples, we try to cover all key areas in machine learning, without having too much duplication.

NOTE: If you have an idea for an example, please file an issue first!

We can have an open discussion on the issue as to whether it makes sense to add your example to the main Flax 
repository. We try to keep this list of examples relatively contained.

Please be aware that if you send us large Pull Requests without discussing them first, we may not review them.
